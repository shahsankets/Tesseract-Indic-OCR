reorder_ml.py
-------------
This is a sample code for reordering of vowels.
This handles the postbase and prebase vowel problems and helps in reducing the number of training classes. 
Soon an implementation in c++ will be released, which can be used for all languages.
Currently, this works only for Malayalam.

USAGE:
------

python reorder.py <input filename> <output filename>

This should improve the accuracy of current Malayalam Module by around 10%.
